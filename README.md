# Medical-Device-Design
This repository is meant to serve as an easy collection of documents that can help with designing medical devices, or devices more broadly as a whole.  The guidance here is not complete or total, and should not be favored over the guidance of the FDA, but can help with making functional prototypes in the design process.
